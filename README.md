# Women's Health and Wellness Guide

## Overview

As an independent nation, we must ensure respect and security for women, as well as provide them with basic rights that they deserve. It is now time to take action to eradicate issues of insecurity and challenge the societal taboos surrounding women. 

In recent years, womenâ€™s rights and gender equality have become central topics of discussion. Society seems to be divided into two views:
1. Allow women to compete in society and earn a livelihood.
2. Let women stay at home and be homemakers.

In both cases, women face daily struggles, whether they are at home or working outside. We cannot ignore the tensions and challenges women face daily.

To address these challenges, we propose a website that aims to be a woman's hand-on guide for her daily routine and the problems she may encounter. This application will help women maintain good health and boost their self-confidence.

## About the Project

The proposed website will offer a comprehensive guide to women regarding their health and wellness. Features include:

- **Menstrual Cycle Tracker**: Women can check their upcoming menstrual cycle by inputting the date and duration of their previous cycle.
- **Fitness Guide**: Learn various exercises, including yoga, to stay fit and healthy.
- **Pregnancy Information**: Access guidelines on how to take care of oneself during pregnancy.
- **Self-Care Tips**: Learn about self-care during different stages of life.

The website will be built using **HTML** and **CSS** for the front-end, with **JavaScript** handling the back-end logic.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content and layout of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling and designing the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For backend logic and providing interactive features.
